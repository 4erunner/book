== Events and the Message Bus

Another new requirement:  when allocation succeeds, someone should be emailed.
But we don't want to have email-sending code be a potential cause of
bugs/failures in our core model/state changes.  We introduce events and
a message bus as a pattern for kicking off related work after a use case is
complete.
