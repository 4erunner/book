== Bootstrap (aka Configuration Root)

NOTE: placeholder chapter, under construction

Congratulations on reading an appendix! Not everyone does.  And yet we
hide so much good stuff in here...

OK at the end of <<chapter_12_dependency_injection>> we'd left a slightly
ugly thing -- there's a circular dependency between _flask_app.py_ and
_redis_pubsub.py_.  Also we had some duplication of boilerplate setup/init
code in those two entrypoints, which felt a bit rough.

Explicitly defining a single "entrypoint" or bootstrap script or "configuration
root" in OO parlance, is a pattern that can help us to keep things tidy.  Let's
take a look.


=== Defaults and Config

Where do we declare our defaults?  _config.py_ is one place, but we also do
some in, eg, _unit_of_work.py_, which declares the "default" database session
manager. maybe that's not too bad...

[[default_session_factory]]
.Default config declared next to uow (src/allocation/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(
    config.get_postgres_uri(),
    isolation_level="SERIALIZABLE",
))
----
====

There is some other config spread around though, like what our "normal"
dependencies are, and we haven't even spoken about cross-cutting concerns
like logging.


=== Other Setup Code: Initialization

Defaults are maybe feeling a bit messy, but so are some other aspects of the
initial setup or "bootsrapping" of our application; `orm.start_mappers()` for
example, or `uow.bus = bus`. We call them in various places in our tests, and at
least twice in our "real" application...


[[flask_calls_start_mappers]]
.Flask calls start_mappers (src/allocation/flask_app.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="existing"]
----
app = Flask(__name__)
orm.start_mappers()
uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork()
bus = messagebus.MessageBus(
    uow=uow,
    ...
)
uow.bus = bus



@app.route("/add_batch", methods=['POST'])
def add_batch():
----
====


Let's bring all this stuff together into a single "bootstrap script" and see
if we end up in a better position.


=== Bootstrap Script

Here's what a bootstrap script could look like:

[[bootstrap_v1]]
.A bootstrap function (src/allocation/bootstrap.py)
====
[source,python]
----
def bootstrap(
        start_orm=orm.start_mappers,
        session_factory=DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY,
        notifications=None,
        publish=redis_pubsub.publish,
) -> messagebus.MessageBus:
    start_orm()
    uow = unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory=session_factory)
    if notifications is None:
        notifications = EmailNotifications(smtp_host=EMAIL_HOST, port=EMAIL_PORT)
    bus = messagebus.MessageBus(uow=uow, notifications=notifications, publish=publish)
    uow.bus = bus
    return bus
----
====

* it declares default dependencies but allows you to override them
* it does the "init" stuff that we need to get our app going in one place
* it gives us back the core of our app, the messagebus


=== Using Bootstrap in our Entrypoints

In our application's entrypoints, we just call `bootstrap.bootstrap()`
to get a messagebus, rather than configuring a UoW and the rest of it.

[[flask_calls_bootstrap]]
.Flask calls bootstrap (src/allocation/flask_app.py)
====
[source,python]
----
app = Flask(__name__)
bus = bootstrap.bootstrap()


@app.route("/add_batch", methods=['POST'])
def add_batch():
    ...
    bus.handle(cmd)
    return 'OK', 201
----
====


And in tests, we can use our `bootstrap.bootstrap()` with overridden defaults
to get a custom messagebus:


[[custom_bootstrap]]
.Overriding bootstrap defaults (tests/integration/test_views.py)
====
[source,python]
----
@pytest.fixture
def sqlite_bus(sqlite_session_factory):
    bus = bootstrap.bootstrap(
        start_orm=lambda: None,
        session_factory=sqlite_session_factory,
        notifications=mock.Mock(),
        publish=mock.Mock(),
    )
    yield bus
    clear_mappers()


def test_allocations_view(sqlite_bus):
    sqlite_bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku1batch', 'sku1', 50, None))
    sqlite_bus.handle(commands.CreateBatch('sku2batch', 'sku2', 50, date.today()))
    ...
    assert views.allocations('order1', sqlite_bus.uow) == [
        {'sku': 'sku1', 'batchref': 'sku1batch'},
        {'sku': 'sku2', 'batchref': 'sku2batch'},
    ]

=== Dependency Diagrams


In chapter 9 (<<chapter_09_dependency_graph>>), it's a real mess:

[[chapter_09_dependency_graph]]
.Dependency graph for chapter 9 (it's a mess)
image::images/chapter_09_dependency_graph.png[]

By chapter 10 (<<chapter_10_dependency_graph>>), when we introduce DI, things
are much better:

[[chapter_10_dependency_graph]]
.Dependency graph for chapter 10 (it's better)
image::images/chapter_10_dependency_graph.png[]

Does the bootstrap script help? As <<appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_1>>
shows, the answer is: "kinda."

[[appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_1]]
.Dependency graph with bootstrap script
image::images/appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_1.png[]


Well kinda-not actually.  That Redis circular dependency is still there and
looking ugly.

One fix is to split the "pub" from the "sub", as in
<<appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_2>>:

[[appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_2]]
.Dependency graph with bootstrap script and no circular deps
image::images/appendix_bootstrap_dependency_graph_2.png[]

Now we have what our esteemed tech reviewer David Seddon would call a "rocky
road architecture": all the dependencies flow in one direction.

TODO: alternative fix by making an abstract redis thingie?
