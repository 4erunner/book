# Why are you the best person to write this book?

Harry has already written one excellent Python book for O'Reilly,  this will make a nice sequel.
Bob knows more than Harry about the subject matter though.


# Book Summary:

* In one sentence, tell us why the audience will want to buy your book.

There are no books on software architecture in Python yet!


* Summarize what the book is about, like you would pitch it to a potential reader on the back cover.  What makes your book unique in the marketplace?

As Python grows in popularity as a language, typical projects are getting larger and more complex, and issues of software design and architecture become more salient.  Patterns like "Ports and Adapters", as well Domain-Driven Design, Event-Driven programming, Command-Query separation, which are well known in more "enterprisey" communities like Java and C#, are generating more interest in the Python community.  This book will provide an introduction to these topics using concrete examples written in Python. It will explaining how to avoid some of the particularities of Java and C# syntax and implement these patterns in a "Pythonic" way.


* Briefly explain the technology and why it is important.


# Audience:

* Explain who the primary audience is for your book. What skills can you assume they have mastered?

This is an intermediate-level book.  It will be of interest to anyone working on codebases of more than moderate complexity, and anyone with an interest in applying architectural patterns common in the C#/Java world to Python.  It will also be of interest to software architects and developers coming from those communities and looking to adapt to the Python world.

* Please estimate as best you can how many people will use this technology? Please state any applicable statistics (e.g., web searches, web site traffic, blogs) indicating market use or market growth.


* Please provide some scenarios that indicate how the audience will use your book. For example, will readers refer to it daily as a reference? Will they read it once to learn the concepts and then refer to it occasionally?


# Key Topic Coverage:

* What problems does this book solve for its users?

* List the four or five topics covered or features included that will provide the greatest benefit to readers or will be the most likely to excite them? 


# Other Book Features and Video Offerings:

* Is there a companion web site? If so, what do you plan to include on the site? Would you be willing to participate in video offerings as well as workshops and training seminars?


# Competition:

* What books or online resources compete with this book? Please list the title and author. In each case, how will your book be different or better in timing, content, coverage, approach, or tone?



# Book Outline (chapter level is fine):


# Specs and Schedule:

* How many pages do you expect the book to be?

* How long do you expect it to take you to write the book?
