== Summary diagram and table

Here's what our architecture looks like by the end of the book:

| Layer | Component | Description

.5+a| *Domain*

__Defines the business logic.__


| Entity | A domain object whose attributes may change, but that has a recognizable identity over time.

| Value Object | An immutable domain object whose attributes entirely define it. It is fungible with other identical objects.

| Aggregate | Cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the purpose of data changes.  Defines and enforces a consistency boundary.

| Event | Represents something that happened.

| Command | Represents a job the system should perform.

.3+a| *Service Layer*

__Defines the jobs the system should perform and orchestrates different components.__

| Handler | Receives a Command or Event and performs what needs to happen.
| Unit of Work | Abstraction around data integrity. Each unit of work represents an atomic update.  Makes repositories available. Tracks new events on retrieved aggregates.
| Message Bus (Internal) | Handles Commands and Events by routing them to the appropriate Handler.

.2+a| *Adapters* (Secondary)

__Concrete implementations of an interface that goes from our system out
to the outside world / I/O.__

| Repository | Abstraction around persistent storage. Each Aggregate has its own Repository.
| Event Publisher | Pushes Events onto the external message bus.

.2+a| *Entrypoints* (Primary adapters)

__Translate external inputs into calls into the service layer.__

| Web | Receives web requests and translates them into Commands, passing them to the Internal Message Bus.
| Eventconsumer | Reads Events from the External Message Bus and translates them into Commands, passing them to the Internal Message Bus.

| n/a | External Message Bus (Message Broker) | A piece of infrastructure that different services use to intercommunicate, via Events.
