<h1>Lightweight Enterprise Architecture Patterns with Python</h1>
<!--(only include edition line if it's 2e or higher -->
<!-- TODO DS
About the title: I like the LEAP acronym, but I'm not sure it accurately describes the book.(i) I'm not sure what 'lightweight' means here - it's not really mentioned in the book, it feels to me like it's there just to make the acronym better.(ii) 'Patterns' - this suggests a patterns book, but I don't think this is one. They tend to be structured a little differently. This is more a book about one particular configuration of patterns.(iii) 'Enterprise' - I am in two minds about the use of this word so prominently. On the one hand I like it, because it identifies the gap that this book is addressing. On the other, it's possible it doesn't mean much to a lot of Python people - it's not a word I hear used much in that world.Having read the book, the key idea that would make me want to read it is that it's a guide to structuring large, complex applications using Python.
