== Validation

NOTE: placeholder chapter, under construction.

Places we can do validation, and different types of validation:

1. event/command schemas
2. at service layer
3. in model (business rules)
4. at exit boundaries (?)


Topics to discuss:

* Validate at the edges, don't program defensively inside
* Difference between syntax and semantics
* Discuss patterns for validating messages
* Talk about reasons for loosely validating messages in the consumer, tolerant reader et c.
